So you're traveling in Nepal and you've accumulated more stuff than what can fit comfortably in your pack. What now? *Epiphany*, ship the stuff home!

### Materials Needed

- Box
- Stuff to ship
- Passport
- Translator
- Packing tape
- Knife or cutting tool
- Thick permanent marker
- 2-3 hours on a non-holiday

### Preparation

Place all of your things into a plastic bag. I won't go into where to find plastic bags, because if you've bought anything, you probably already have a small collection as they give you little plastic bags for *every* purchase. Finding cardboard boxes however can be a little tougher. Ask for them at convenient stores and markets, they usually have a stash they are more than willing to give out. They also use them as trash cans along the streets, which is how I *acquired* one of my boxes (yes, I stole someone's trashcan). Anyway, place items in plastic bag (essentially creating a box liner *just in case*), then into box. Temporarily close the box with your stuff inside with a very small piece of packing tape (that you can find at paper shops and some bookstores). Depending on the wall strength of the box, you might want to re-enforce the bottom edges and corners. You know what, just wrap the whole thing in tape at the bottom and sides, why not? Just make sure you can still open it.  

### Note: Pokhara and Baglung locations

Shipping only works from Kathmandu, Nepal. If you're a trekker in Pokhara, the post office there does not send *any* package mail, so you'll have to pay double or *triple* the price to use a carrier like Fedex, UPS, DHL and the like. You could go to Baglung (hour and a half by bus), but there you are limited to 2kg per box, so if you've got a lot of stuff you'll need to split it into many boxes and then it might get expensive. 

### Location in Kathmandu 

![Dharahara]({{ site.static }}/img/post/dharahara.jpg)

So you may have seen this really tall white pillar (Dharahara) to the South-South-East of Thamel. The Post Office (<a href=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Sundhara+General+Post+Office&hl=en&ll=27.702642,85.313129&spn=0.007523,0.013797&t=m&z=16 target=_blank>google map</a>) is right below that in a district called Sundhara. Basically, just go south from Thamel and keep asking people for Sundhara Post Office or Dharahara, they are really nice and will help. For the most part they will just point the way that you are pointing, which makes me feel like they understand me, when in reality they don't because I was pronouncing Sundhara as "shug-hara", which was probably very confusing. Remember to bring the box, tape, and your passport! If you want to be a sissy and take a taxi or rikshaw, then fine, be that way.  

### Ok, I'm here 

![Postal Sign]({{ site.static }}/img/post/postal-sign.jpg)

First, you will be directed to the EMS (Express Mail Service?) in room No. 32 to use the scale to weigh your box. Remember or write down the weight, you will need it for the customs form. They will point you to room No. 28, customs, which is *outside* the back of the building. When you get there it will be an absolute madhouse with sewing, taping, boxes, and utter chaos and disorder. Everyone will be competing for the attention of one guy, and you should be too. He will give you yellow customs papers to fill out with directions that are *entirely in Nepali*. 

#### Customs Form <a name=translator></a>

Here is where you need a translator friend. There are sorta some translations scribbled on example forms taped to the some of the desks, but they were impossible to read. Ask some of the younger people there to help. Their English is usually pretty good and they are always helpful, especially if you have extra tape for them to seal up their boxes. Fill out the form to the best of your ability, and if you screw up no problem, this is Nepal, they don't really care. 

#### Inspection

After you finish filling out the form, give it back to "the guy" and he will ask you to open your box. They have an odd list of things you're not allowed to send, the one that got me was batteries. They were in a *broken steripen* (seriously one drop from a meter high and the bulb stops working) and he requested that I remove them. Just be prepared to remove things that they will not let you ship. He will give the all clear and then you can seal up the box. 

#### Bag and tag

Next step is to cover every piece of exposed cardboard with tape. Hopefully you brought a knife or scissors to cut the tape. Next, you give your wad of tape with a box inside to one of the box tailors and they will wrap it up nicely in cloth, hand stitch the edges, and seal parts of the stitching in wax and rubber ink stamps. The wax is awesome tamper-proofing. Then you can write shipping info all over the box with the permanent marker, just look around in the chaos for examples of what to do. Show the box to "the guy", and he will give you the paperwork back and ask for money. For me it was 750rs for a large 6kg box (I'm pretty sure it is not a bribe), and you then go back to EMS room No. 32. 
 
### Final Step!

So you're in room No. 32, with it's long counters and boxes everywhere. Somewhere there will be a notebook; put your name in the notebook and you are now in the queue. Wait. They will yell your name and give you a piece of paper where you put the mailing information again (for the 3rd time). Once you fill out the paper, wait by the scale until it is free and put your box on it, this gives you priority. To ship to the USA it is something like 1200rs for 500g and 400rs for each additional 500g. So my 6Kg (6000g) package was 5900rs ($62). Pay the man, he will give you receipts and *you're done*.

### Storytime <a name=storytime></a>

Shipping from Pokhara using a 3rd party shipper does not always work so well. Not only is it much more expensive, but my friend had things stolen out of the package. Seriously, they took all the good stuff out of the package and *still sent it*. They also mailed some unmailed postcards that were in the package, which is baffling. We think the theft was perpetrated by the people working in the office she was shipping from. Beware, send via Nepali post from Kathmandu, it's the one with the fabric and wax seal.

### Conclusion

Shipping with the Nepali post from Kathmandu is an *adventure* that will take 2-3 hours of your day, but it is relatively cheap and probably more secure than through a third party (I will confirm when my package arrives in the US). I for one will be using the wax sealed fabric bag in the future, it is awesome. It feels so medieval, like sending a package with the king's wax seal. 

> By order and decree of myself, I do declare that this package shall only be opened by whom I am sending it to and by no other, upon penalty of death by un-pleasantries. - King Dita  

I *know* that the box is either going to be x-rayed or opened by US customs. They probably don't accept the word of "the guy" as to what is in the package, so US customs will be going through my package wondering why I am sending back a stinky sleeping bag and a Nepali hat.
