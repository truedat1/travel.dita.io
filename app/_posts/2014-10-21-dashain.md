There is an ethical reason for killing animals, sorta...

In Nepal, we just celebrated the Hindu holiday of Dashain.

Basically, the evil demon Mahishasura was causing problems in the land of the Gods and they were getting kinda annoyed so the other gods said, "Durga, go deal with him". Durga's like "ok".

So Durga and Mahishasura fight for 8 days when finally Durga's like "I'm sick of this crap", and manifests the blood-thirsty demon god Kali.

Kali, being Kali, is like "make sacrifices to ME!" and the people of earth are like "yes, ma'am, right away", so they start killing buffalo, goats, ducks, and pidgins to appease Kali so she will battle with Mahishasura.

Kali wins, god land is saved and happy ending.

So, it is ethical to kill animals when the demon Mahishasura is threatening god land and Kali demands blood to care enough to fight him.

tldr: Probably tens of thousands of goats died earlier this month.
