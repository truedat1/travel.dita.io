description: "Nepal: land of garage doors"
---

Nepal is a land full of garage doors. They are built into just about every building, regardless of location. 

For cars right? Nope. Few Nepalis have cars, however many have motorcycles or scooters (have you ever seen a family of 4 on a scooter?). They do not store those in the garages, they prefer to park them on the streets, in the entryways or interior courtyards of their buildings, and preferably up a couple of stairs. There is no word for "motorcycle" in Nepali, it's odd to hear english words in the middle of a heated argument.   

These are thick belted steel garage doors, heavy, very loud to open and close. Unintentionally bullet-proof although gun violence is extremely rare. Crooks prefer the intimacy of kukri knives.

Secured behind these garage doors are stores, cafes, groceries selling trekking supplies, teas, trinkets, tourist keep sakes, kukri knives, scarves, cloth, services like motorcycle hire, shoe repair, and tailoring. Although most of the stores sell similar if not the same items, they are independently owned and operated. There are very few chain stores. 

Most do not have store fronts, opening directly into the streets, sometimes only a single light hanging from a wire to light the entire garage area.   

I find this model much more appealing than the employment concept in the US of predominantly working for larger companies, rather than for yourself. Most shop owners live right above their shops, open and close when they want, and have a degree of freedom and ownership of their trade.
