The streets of any town or village in Nepal is filled with women adorned in either jeans and T-shirts (just like the West), full body wrappings of beautiful scratchy fabrics, or a long shirt and billowy pants combo. Usually they look pretty comfy (except in jeans), which is good, since women do a lot of the house and industrial work in this culture (like in most cultures). 

With the humidity, jeans are just about the least comfortable thing to wear, and most of the younger men and women go for it. I feel pressured to wear jeans to fit in, rather than wearing the light weight trekker pants that are sold in every other garage door stall.

What always strikes me is how many shiny adornments there are on clothing. Tinsel sewn into everything, like they're trying to scare birds from fruit trees. On most of the nicer clothing, there is a symbol that looks similar to a fishing lure. And it's everywhere. 

I've never really understood fashion. So much so that now I just have my friends tell me what to wear. My requirement for the last shirt I bought was it needed to be a natural fiber, and it could be worn for a week straight without being washed.

My new shirt is cotton, does not have fishing lures on it (it's a ladies fashion thing anyway), was the equivalent of 2 dollars, and has a random after thought side pocket that I never put anything into because there are places you put pockets and there are places where you don't.

I bought some nice cotton trekking pants, red in color, only to have them dye all of my white shirts pink when I had them washed. I'm in the market for gray shirts.
