[Swayambhunath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swayambhunath) is a Buddhist Stupa that is also called "Monkey Temple", though most tourists will not see it live up to its name. When I have been there during the day there are only a couple of monkeys here and there.

At night, a WHOLE different story. Hundreds, probably approaching a thousand monkeys surround the stupa, so thick that it is very difficult to do bhakti (devotion) at this site without fear of injuring or being attacked by toddler sized demons.

Don't bring food, they will smell it and you will face a snarling, frothing monkey out for your dinner. I had to rescue my friend by shaking my backpack and yelling at it to get enough distance so we could make a run for it. 

There are a lot of stairs. So watch out for that. 

And baby monkeys are basically the cutest thing ever.
