Who keeps defacing Buddha's statues? They are covered in red powder, mouthes stuffed with rice. Just like, ... wait ... all the statue depictions of Hindu Gods.

Buddha is considered to be an incarnation of Vishnu and worshiped along with Shiva, Ganesh, Krishna and the lot.

Buddhists, for the most part, do not worship Hindu Gods with the same reverence, making them the more exclusive of the two major religious in Nepal.
