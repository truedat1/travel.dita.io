Who keeps defacing Buddha's statues? Covered in red powder, mouths stuffed with rice just like ... wait ... all the statues of Hindu Gods.

To Hindus, Buddha is considered to be an incarnation of Vishnu and worshiped along with Shiva, Ganesh, Krishna.

Buddhists for the most part, do not worship Hindu Gods with the same reverence, making them the more exclusive of the two major religions in Nepal.
