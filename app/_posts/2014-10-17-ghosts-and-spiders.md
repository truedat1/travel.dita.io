Never whistle inside a Nepali house after dark. 

They believe it brings ghosts. 

I've slept in a garden house full of spiders (no Mosquitos though) for the last week. Since seeing 'Aracniphobia' as a child, I've battled a fear of spiders. Cob webs connect the walls and ceiling and round the corners, probably hundreds of spiders for hundreds of webs are in this house.  

First night, I was scared (I'll admit it, like a real man). Anchored at the foot of the bed was a spider about the diameter of a tennis ball, deep brown with reflective eyes that glinted in the beam of my headlamp. The mosquito netting was for spiders that night.  

Second night, it seemed the spiders, and possibly ghosts, and I had reached some kind of functional agreement. They no longer minded me (if they ever did, I like to think I'm special) and I feared them no more. The spider at the foot of the bed had disappeared in the night, and was back in the same place the following evening. Creepy.

Tommi, the only German Shepard in Baglung and foremost terror to small children despite her playful disposition, was my ever present sentry in the garden outside. Making my haunted, spider den the safest house in the city on the outside. Inside, I was on my own with the spiders. 

Apparently, a woman was decapitated yesterday (rumor mill). Still feel safer than in the US. 

Maybe I should get a guard dog, or a backbone.
