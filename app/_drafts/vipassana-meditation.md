tldr: Vipassana Meditation is extremely difficult, but also extremely rewarding and I recommend it for anyone in search of happiness. 

If you don't have time to read all 4168 words of this post in one sitting, go to the [Reality](#reality) section for a quick summary of the experience, then read the rest when you have time.

I've gotten lots of inquiries about my recent 10 day [Vipassana Meditation](http://www.dhamma.org) and instead of writing and sending out a whole bunch of redundant messages on the little bandwidth that this country offers, I figure I'll post a blog about it then field more specific questions individually. 

I encourage questions and [feedback](#bottom), also I ask your forgiveness for the many spelling and grammatical errors contained in the following post, I've been sitting at this cafe since breakfast and it is past dinnertime. 


## Introduction

I originally heard about Vipassana Meditation while in an ashram outside of Buenos Aries back in early 2011. A couple that was staying there had just finished a [10 day course](2) in Ecuador and highly recommended it, but did not give me much information about the course. So I archived it in the back of my mind as something for further research. 

At some point in 2011 or 2012 I ended up with a documentary called [Doing Time, Doing Vipassana](1) which is about a Vipassana course taught at a prison in New Delhi that is wildly successful, with clips of inmates hugging guards, and all these people saying how much it had helped their rehabilitation in prison. I decided that at some point I wanted to do this meditation. 

Fast forward to Nepal 2014, another friend here in Nepal said that she had completed a course and that there was a center here in Pokhara, where I am currently. So I tried to get into a course there starting October 1st, but it was full, then tried for another center in Chitwan (8 hours away), but they did not get back to me after a week, so then I called and confirmed for Lombini (also 8 hours away). 

Lombini was my last choice because it is in the plains (Terai) region of Nepal where it is very hot, although I am very glad that I ended up doing it there in hindsight. Gautama Buddha (THE Buddha) is thought to have been born under a bodhi tree at Lombini 2500 years ago, this will be important later. 


## History

Vipassana meditation is considered to be a Buddhist meditation, only because it was taught by Gautama Buddha, the man who introduced Buddhist philosophy and *inspired* the Buddhist religion. However, in Vipassana it really does not matter what one believes because the core of Vipassana is directly experienced, more on this later.  

After Gautama Buddha achieve enlightenment under the bodhi tree, he began to teach people the path that he had discovered. A tool to assist people in this path was Vipassana Meditation. 

After 40+ years of teaching, Gautama dies under a bodhi tree (note that there are 3 separate bodhi trees in the life of Gautama), and the technique that he was teaching gained wide popularity in India 2500 years ago. A king somewhere around 300 years after Gautama's death was helped by Vipassana so much that he sent teachers to other lands so that others could benefit. One of these places was Burma (Myanmar) where a monastery was established. Apparently, they continued to practice Vipassana meditation in its purity at this monastery for 2500 years, while throughout India, people started to change the technique adding other modalities and gradually it fell out of favor as people stopped getting the benefits due to the changes (seriously, humanity can't have nice things). 

In the 1970's, a Burmese businessman with a psychosomatic migraine named S.N. Goenka spend 14 years studying in the monastery. Moving to India, he then started teaching what he learned, and its popularity exploded. Currently, there are something like 150 centers in 30 different countries.

This is all history that they said at the course so I take it with a grain of salt.  


## Beginning 

Upon arriving at the center, you are requested to surrender all valuables, all electronics, all foods, all writing and reading materials, all money, all religious materials and superstitious artifacts, passport and mobile phone. For me, this amounted to a trashbag bag that weighed about 15 pounds, the only thing that I still had in my backpack was clothes and some tools. All things were safely returned at the end of the course, it was nice to not have to worry about them. 

You are requested to maintain 5 rules that include no sexual activity, no lying (which does not really apply because you are silent), the usual monastic rules. 

They ask that you discontinue all religious practices like malas, prayer, and other meditations, also all exercise except basic stretching and walking to give a fair trial to the technique.


## Silence

After the initial presentation and dinner, you are requested not to communicate with other participants IN ANY WAY, no talking, no gestures, no signing, no notes, no empathetic connecting, none nothing nada. For me this was daunting because I tend to be quite sensitive to others body language and can usually experience what they are feeling by looking into their eyes. This amounts to everyone walking around admiring the nice brickwork on the ground and each others' shoes. I tried to wear a shall over my head to make it more difficult to look people in the eyes, but it was way too hot to place anything over the head and found that without my glasses on, which I did not need for most of the week, I did not really have as many issues empathetically connecting as I thought I would. In a weird way, this is one of the most powerful parts about the meditation course. Although there are other people there, since you are not communicating with them, it is like doing the meditation in isolation. 

They only times you talk are to the assistant teachers to clarify questions about the technique and to the staff if you need anything relating to the accommodations or food. 


## Daily Routine 

4am Wakeup, meditate, eat, meditate, eat, nap, meditate, eat, meditate, lecture, meditate, bed at 9pm. 

10.5 hours meditation, 3 hours meals, 1.5 hours lecture, 1 hour nap. A total of 12 hours are spend sitting on a 2x2 foot cushion in the meditation hall. 

Meditations sessions were 2 hours, 1.5 hours, or 1 hour long with a 5 min break in between which was just enough time to get a drink of water and pee. There was a 30 min at the very end of the day, but that was about enough time get comfy, start meditating, then it was over. 


## Food

I know some of you food addicts, sorry "fast oxidizers", are dying to know what the food was like. It was for the most part basic Nepali fare (being that this was in Nepal and all). Breakfast was usually a porridge made of millet(?) with way too much sugar in it, a small cup of lentil or chickpea soup, maybe chapati (flat bread, like pita), and tea. Lunch was Dal Bhat (mountain of rice, lentil soup, veggie curry, potato curry, chapati). Dinner was essentially rice crispy cereal mixed with corn flakes with maybe a couple of peanuts and tea, students who have done a course before are not given dinner, just water and lemon. 


## Accommodations

The grounds are split by a segregation fence to separate men from women, the only time to see women is in the meditation hall but I never did because I did not have my glasses on, there are 2 dorms with 2 beds per room, the rooms have concrete beds, a mattress as thick as a towel folded over twice and pillow that feels like a wool blanket stuffed into a pillow case, squat toilet and sink in the bathroom, a shower head but no water came from it, bathing took place with a series of buckets and a spigot, no hot water. Segregated dining halls and you were served on metal plates in a soup kitchen style cafeteria lineup not buffet style. You washed your own dishes. You could also use the buckets in the bathroom to wash your own laundry, and there were laundry lines, the yard had a lilly pad pond, some holy basil plants, banana trees,  5 foot tall monkeys with terrifying black faces, and a perimeter pathway around the dorms where we could walk for exercise.  

Basically a prison no bars and a separate bathroom. A freedom cell.


## Technique

Vipassana meditation does not actually start until the afternoon of the 4th day. Up until that point, Anapana Meditation is done. This meditation is to focus the mind on perceiving more subtle sensations on the body. What it amounts to is spending 10.5 hours a day for 4.5 days focusing on the sensation of the breath passing over the skin/hair just under the nostrils as it flows in and out. It was initially made easier for me because I am trying once again to grow a beard, so there were a couple of longer mustache hairs to catch the breath sensation. No the beard looks horrible, I should cut it off, laziness is the only thing stopping me. 

Vipassana meditation expands on anapana meditation, using the newly focused mind to perceive subtle sensations on the rest of the body by mentally scanning from the top of the head to the bottom of the feet, moving from body part to body part when sensation is felt. Sensation can be anything, heat, cold, itching, pain (so much pain), moisture (so much sweat) etc. When sensations is felt, it is treated with equanimity (not good or bad) and the knowledge of its impermanence (anicha). An example would be scanning the arm, the mental thoughts would be; "ok shoulder, what do you got for me, waiting, waiting, that is the sensation of air from the fan above, moving on, ok upper arm, I'm feeling that the skin is cold, moving on, ok elbow, that is pain in the elbow because it has not moved I am going to not like or dislike it, ok forearm .... etc".     

The technique is taught by Goenka on audiotape (d.2013), he is the teacher, there are assistant teachers that you can talk to if you have questions.  


## Reality <a name=reality></a>

The technique is what you're supposed to be doing, what you're really doing is the following: "so tired, when's lunch, i wish this was over, jesus my back hurts, woah FOCUS breath in i feel it on the nostrils, breath out feel it on the nostrils, that jackhammer is annoying and loud I dont like it, i wonder how may raspian virtualization layers I could put on a plug computer using docker, I have not heard the guy on the mat in front of me move in a while he must be enlightened and I don't like him, there is a sweat bead on the tip of my nose and if I dont flick it off I will certainly die, I am being stabbed in the back right now, crap FOCUS breath in the nose and, my back, it certainly has been 2 hours they are going to ring the bell any second you can do it, my back, it feels like i just went swimming in sticky, damn back, oh I like the tingling in my foot right now, back, I should never have said that the shirt was not flattering to her figure, gopros are devices solely to make others feel that their lives suck, I hear that enlighten guy move oh thank god now I can move, back hurts moving, still hurts moving, pain, back, back pain, baCk PaiN, BAckPaIn, backPAIN, pain pain pain painpainpainpainpainpainpainaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa WHY AM I HERE WHY AM I DOING THIS I WANT SMOKEDRINKCRYSMASHFUCKSLEEPEATDRUGS"

My room mate left on the third day, 8 people out of 70 left during the 10 days, most within 3 days.    


## Why

From what I've written so far I'm sure that none of you are interested in doing this meditation. But here is why you should be. 


## Equanimity and Anicha

Both pleasurable and painful sensations are an essential part of Vipassana, what is slowly understood by the experience is that these sensations are not actually the issue that causes suffering, they are just sensations, feelings on or in the body. What actually causes suffering is craving and aversion to these sensations. Our reactions to these sensations. 

By treating each sensation with Equanimity, not judging it as good or bad (it just is), and Anicha (understanding the impermanence of the sensation, that it will end) it makes each sensation much easier to deal with. It's not ignoring the sensation, it is simply not reacting to the sensation. 

The most important concept of Vipassana is Equanimity, changing our reactions.

If it is a pleasurable sensation the mind wants to react with craving, it want more of this sensation, but since the nature of sensations is that they will pass, when the sensation does pass we suffer because we desire more and are no longer receiving any. 

If it is an un-pleasurable sensation the mind reacts with aversion, wanting less, but the sensation will pass as all sensation do, and when we react with aversion it causes suffering while the sensation is present.  

Craving and aversion are wanting a present moment to be different, rather than accepting the present moment as it is. This is the root of suffering. 


## Another Level

I came to the realization that the worst sensation is not actually pain, it is itching on the nose or scalp. The desire/craving reaction to scratch is so powerful, it takes every single ounce of willpower to sit and wait for it to end. It is unbearable, the suffering is unimaginable, I have experience hell, it is an unscratched itch.   

During the meditation, due to the sensitivity of the mind in its ability to pick up body sensations, being free from distractions and being entirely focused on scanning, the mind begins to pick up subtle sensations that are usually only experienced by the subconscious mind. For everyone these are different, I experience these subtle sensations as tingly heat, some others experience them as electricity or numbness.

On the 5th day, you are told to try and not move your hands or uncross your legs for the entire hour long group sittings, three times per day. Usually people are moving every 5 or so minutes to try and be comfortable when the mind is too distracted by pain and discomfort, but a lot of the movements are reactionary and subconscious, like scratching the nose when there is an itch.


## Fire

On the 6th day, I had the experience of a sensation of subtle tingly heat spreading where ever I was focusing while scanning, but after I was totally still for at least 15 minutes. This subtle heat would persist after my mind had moved to another spot, creating a warm tingly sensation all over the body. Because I could already feel the heat sensation over large parts of my body, scanning became hard because I would move from head to toe quickly (shoulder heat, upper arm heat, elbow heat, etc), I could already feel sensation everywhere. It was pleasurable, I wanted more (WRONG). I did not know what was happening, I though I was going into this mythical samma samadhi that is supposed to happen to advanced yogis, the mind was so quiet. In this state, pain was there, but unimportant. I craved the pleasurable heat, I wanted more. I felt like I could meditate endlessly. In my foolishness, I started experimenting. Some of my previous energy work experience has taught me how to channel aspects of my chi/prana and in this state of tingly heat, I started focusing around where my belt buckle would be, which is Dan Tien, the storage area of chi/prana in the body, to see what would happen (WRONG). The tingling and heat got way more intense, it was flowing upward like fire erupting from the body, so enjoyable. It was magnificent. I must be enlightened, this must be. It feels so good. It's waining, press on dan tien more keep it going. It's still disappearing, I'm loosing the sensation, my pleasure is leaving, come back, press for more chi, bring it back, don't leave, I crave you. I'm suffering. Your gone, come back. I crave.

This episode lasted probably 10 minutes. I've previously had similar sensations to this in kundalini yoga, but none this intense.  

"What the fuck was that" - alex, day 6


## Realization

I screwed up. Perpetually screwing up. It is the habit of the mind to have aversion to pain and craving for pleasure, and within Vipassana I experienced both, many many times. Suffering from unpleasant, and suffering from pleasant. 

Suffering is universal.  

Equanimity is a way out of suffering. 


## Flow

I experienced that not moving and with a mind sharpened by days of endless meditation will cause the mind to feel deep into subtle sensations that are usually hidden from the conscious mind. The experience on the 6th day was clarified that evening when I told the assistant teacher about it. He said it was called the flow, and would be explained in future lectures, I had just experienced it early, it is normal, there is nothing mystical about it, it is just subtle body sensations, and to not crave it, Vipassana is about equanimity.  

I thought I was special.


## Previous Experience (optional)

Due to my work with Bioenergetic fields (biofields) in Quantum Reflex Analysis, my mind was already slightly sensitive to subtle body sensations as I use conscious scanning of a specific area around and below where my tonsils were removed to determine if a particular input has or does not have a bioenergetic field, whether this be a client meridian or a piece of nutrition. I believe this is why I experienced a flow state early. Also, scanning the front of my neck was difficult because if I focused any deeper then skin level (which is my habit), it would trigger the mechanism I use for bioenergetic testing, often leading to me feeling suddenly ill (depending on exterior environment variables), which is actually totally normal for me.

The episode on day 6 also made me feel off for the rest of the day, I feel that I burnt through a good amount of my body's chi/prana when arrogantly experimenting, as my bioenergetic field was collapsed/decreased for a good while afterward.

I know that some of you are not going to understand what the hell I am talking about in this section, which is fine. Dismiss it, it does not have to do with Vipassana, it is for a subset of readers who also directly experience this as I do, or have similar experiences.    


## Another Layer

With a mind sharpened by pointed and focused meditation, another interesting realization comes. Emotional reactions are preceded by subconscious sensations on/in the body. Emotional reactions are themselves reactions to subconscious sensations on/in the body. 

Stimulus come in through one of the 6 sense doors (smell, taste, touch, sight, sound, AND mind), the perception interprets/classifies the stimuli which defines the stimuli, the body reacts to this definition with a subconscious subtle sensation, the conscious mind (ego) then reacts to the subtle subconscious sensation with craving or aversion (or equanimity) manifesting in anger, sadness, happiness, contentment, etc.

Upon returning to the real world after the meditation I had a full email inbox. One of the messages contained some news that clearly displayed this to me. Like most suffering in the world, it was about a woman, she starting to actively seek the attention of other men. I felt this information come into the senses, be defined and the meaning extracted, then I felt a heavy un-pleasant sensation on the solar plexus for a split second, but in my mind I did not react to the body sensation, which normally would have made me sad, because of a craving for a reality which was not the present moment. 

Emotions are reactions to subtle body sensations.

Within Vipassana, these body reactions are called sankaras, reaction patterns. To get rid of sankaras, one must react to them in the conscious mind with equanimity. We experience these reaction patterns in every moment, everything we see, feel, taste, touch, smell, think, hear, is defined and then a sankara exhibits itself, we then emotionally react to that sankara.

We all have felt an strong emotion as a sensation, but realizing that the emotion is reaction to the sensation is absolutely liberating.


## Being a Buddha

After nearly dying trying to cross a river because of intense malnutrition brought by an aesthetic life, Siddhartha Gautama, the prince who would become a Buddha, got fed up with human existence. With fervent persistence and determination, he decided to sit without moving in the shade of a bodhi tree until he either became enlightened or he died. What he experienced was what I experienced, the suffering of craving and of aversion, and the impermanence of all things. What he did, that I have not the will to do, is experience every reaction pattern, clear every sankara to be totally liberated from suffering.

Gautama Buddha was only one Buddha, enlightened person, and he said that there have been many Buddhas before him, and many Buddhas will come after him. Anyone can be a Buddha.

Am I a Buddhist now, no, I'm just a guy trying to be happier.   


## What are we without reaction

Emotional reaction defines much of our decision making. Why we act and speak is usually because we are reacting to an aversion or a craving in thought. The more balanced, equanimus the mind, the more one's actions and speech are dictated by wisdom. Knowledge gained by experience as to what will be the implications of one's actions or speech.


## Lombini

After the meditation, I was exploring Lombini with a guy who has done 36 10-day courses all over the world over 9 years, he said it has totally changed his life for the better. He also said that this was one of the hardest course he had done, it had immense heat, tons of construction noise from the building of another structure right next door, it rained, but most of all, in Asia everyone sits at every meditation session. In Vipassana, you are only required to sit in the meditation hall for 3 one hour sessions per day. The rest of the time you can "meditate" in your room. Also the accommodations were difficult. A meditation prison.

Lombini, being the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, has many monasteries funded by Buddhist groups in other countries. There are Monasteries exhibiting traditions from China, Korea, Cambodia, Japan, Thailand, Canada, France, among others. Each has it's own flair, architecture, instruments, chanting, robs, idol statues, traditions, DOGMA. People have taken the basic teachings and stacked a ton of junk distractions on the top of it, same with most other religions. Seeing huge statues of Gautama Buddha built for praise, glory, and worship, hearing gongs and horns and chants, it forces you to realize that man made God in his own image, man made an egocentric insecure God, because man is egocentric and insecure. Gautama Buddha rejected divinity. He was just a happy man, and what he taught was how to be happy. 


## Accessibility

With many of the other traditions that I have studied, once I start doing the rituals and following the rites, doing the bhakti (devotion), and exhibiting the blind faith, it becomes a waiting game, waiting for the divine to bestow grace on ME. Like winning the celestial lottery. 

Vipassana meditation as a tool shows that if you want to be happy, you have to do the work, but you see the results, there is marked progress. The more I change the habit patterns of the mind to be non-reactive, the less I suffer and the more happy I become. 

Bare with this bad analogy, suffering is like light and happiness is like darkness, happiness is always there, one just needs to turn off the lights, the suffering.


## Warning

These are my interpretations, rationalizations, opinions, and experience, it's not meant to be offensive. If parts resonate with you GREAT, if you are offended, DISMISS that part.     


## Final piece

Wisdom teaches that it is ultimately best to have love and compassion for all beings. So the final component of Vipassana is just that, the spread of love and compassion. 

So I offer you love and compassion and hope that in some way my experience will assist you in your evolution. 

As we say in Vipassana, BE HAPPY!
