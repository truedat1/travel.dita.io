I am called dita. I take photos and write observations. 

### travels

As I write this, I am in Kathmandu, Nepal. I've applied for an Indian Visa and will be traveling into Northern India within the month.

### photography

When I travel, I like to take pictures that can stand alone. I take photos of people, maybe some landscapes, that paint a scene about a place and its inhabitants.

Most of my subjects have no idea they are being photographed, something that may be ethically questionable. 

I hope to tell a story in a single frame, where the photographer is irrelevant.  

### equipment

I'm running pretty minimally on this trip. Trying (in vain) to keep my backpack light.

#### hardware

- Fujifilm X10
- HP Mini 110 

#### software

- GIMP
- Shotwell
- Linux
